# Alfred

## Background

Well, the story began at the first time I watch the movie Ironman. During the first time I enjoy the movie, what shocked me the most is not the armor (or the suit, whatever) of Ironman, it's the artificial intelligence butler which named Jarvis. I must say that having an AI butler become my biggest dream during my high school age. So, after graduating from college for two years, I decided to build my own butler program. And I don't want to name it by the name of Tony Stark's butler, I prefer to call it by the name of Alfred Pennyworth. After all, British butler seems to be more reliable.

At the begging, I want to add some functions to Alfred like recording my health information and analyzing my physical condition. I have a habit of working out, so, it seems to be a good beginning of this project.
